Requirements:
* python 2.7
* python-mnist
* numpy
* xgboost
* sklearn

content:
* We used the mnist-data from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/,
  and parsed it with the python-mnist package.
* We trained the model with n_estimators=30 and achieved 93% accuracy on the test-set.
* You can train a model and then save it to a file,
  and you can then load a model from current file.
* When performing a check on the test-set, it:
    - prints out the accuracy on it
    - prints a confusion matrix
    - prints some samples taken from the test set,
      it prints to the console the image (using 'display' of python-mnist package),
      and then prints the gold label of the image and the predicted label of the model
